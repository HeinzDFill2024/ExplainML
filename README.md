# 🧠 Explainable TinyML Models for Real-Time Speech Recognition in Edge Computing

## 🌐 Project Overview

The emergence of **TinyML** has enabled machine learning on resource-constrained edge devices, revolutionizing real-time applications like speech recognition. However, deploying such models on edge devices remains challenging due to:

- 🚀 **Limited Computational Resources**  
- ⚡ **Energy Efficiency Requirements**  
- ⏱️ **Real-Time Processing Needs**  
- 🔍 **Lack of Model Transparency**

Traditional speech recognition methods often rely on complex architectures (e.g., deep neural networks and transformers) that, while accurate, are computationally intensive and act as black-box models.  

**Our framework addresses these challenges** by introducing an **Explainable TinyML Model for Real-Time Speech Recognition** with:  
- 📈 **Lightweight Feature Extraction**  
- 🕒 **Hybrid Temporal Modeling**  
- 🧠 **Explainability Mechanisms**  

The proposed framework leverages **multi-scale convolutional feature extraction**, **attention-based temporal aggregation**, and an **adaptive decoding strategy** to achieve **state-of-the-art performance** while maintaining real-time capabilities on edge hardware.
